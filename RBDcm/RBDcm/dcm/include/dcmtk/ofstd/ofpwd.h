/** A non-POD version of "struct passwd" for thread- and memory-safe data
 *  access. Wraps the contents of a "struct passwd" instance to a non-POD
 *  object containing RAII-style data (e.g. OFString instead of const char*).
 *  To handle the old pointer behavior, OFPasswd objects can have an invalid
 *  state in which case all members are undefined. You can test whether an
 *  OFPasswd object is invalid or not with the overloaded operators
 *  "operator !" and "operator OFBool". Therefore, it behaves quite the same
 *  way as pointers in this regard.
 *  @note The downside of this non-POD class is that it leads to some
 *    unnecessary string copy operations. The resulting performance penalty
 *    should be insignificant. However, implementing this class based on
 *    auto_ptr / unique_ptr or using c++11 move sematics would prevent that,
 *    if somebody thinks it is necessary.
